# code-sniffer

## The Big Idea
Create a program that is capable of parsing large text files of web pages to sniff out malicious code.

This will be done by using grammar checks and dictionaries to narrow in on obfuscated code that is often nonsensical to hide its nature.

## Concepts
* Bring large text into a scannable format
* Look for common programming lexicons
* Eliminate safe text from the search
* Flag potential stings as nonsensical
* Teach to recognize programming lexicons??
* Natural language processing??
* things to look for: file name and contents of file
